# Admin API

The Verbis API allows you to create and manage your content easily using wide variety of different endpoints. Everything
you are able to do in the admin interface you are able to achieve with the admin API, which makes it incredibly flexible
and dynamic.

All the Verbis endpoints follow REST principles, if you've interacted with a RESTful API already, many of the concepts
will be familiar to you. Requests and responses are JSON encoded throughout with different query parameters available to
filter and search through content easily and quickly.

___

## Structure

### Base URL:

The following URL is used for all API endpoints.

`/api/{version}/`

### Version

After the `/api` segment of the base URL, a version is prefixed with a `v`, dependent on what version of Verbis is
currently being run. For example: `/api/v1/posts`

### Endpoints

As Verbis follows RESTful principles, the following methods are accepted for each endpoint.

- `GET`: for browsing entities, `/api/{version}/posts` or reading an entity by a particular
  key, `/api/{version}/posts/1`
- `POST`: for adding entities, `/api/{version}/posts`
- `PUT`: for updating an entity usually by ID, `/api/{version}/posts/1`
- `DELETE`: for deleting an entity, usually by ID `/api/{version}/posts/1`

## JSON Responses

All endpoints respond with a JSON encoded response, which contains the following:

```json
{
	"status": 200,
	"error": false,
	"message": "Successfully obtained posts",
	"meta": {},
	"data": []
}
```

- `status`: contains an integer of the resulting http status code of the call.
- `error`: contains a boolean to signify if there was an error calling the endpoint.
- `message`: contains a brief message about the status of the call, and a useful description if there was an error.
- `meta`: includes Pagination if the route is a `GET` (browse) endpoint. It also includes `request_time`
  , `response_time` and `latency` times.
- `data`: contains the main body of the call, usually this is an array, but sometimes it can be an object depending on
  the endpoint.

___

## Errors

If the resulting status code of an endpoint is a validation error, the API will respond with some useful information
about what keys are required as an object in the `data` key under `errors`.

```json
{
	"status": 400,
	"error": true,
	"message": "Validation failed",
	"meta": {
		"request_time": "2021-01-01 12:00:00.000000 +0000 UTC",
		"response_time": "2021-01-01 12:00:20.200000 +0000 UTC",
		"latency_time": "20.000ms"
	},
	"data": {
		"errors": [
			{
				"key": "slug",
				"type": "required",
				"message": "Post Slug is required."
			},
			{
				"key": "title",
				"type": "required",
				"message": "Post Title is required."
			}
		]
	}
}
```

The error object contains the following:

- `key`: the key that contains an error.
- `type`: the type of validation error, for example `required` means it's missing from the body and `email` would mean
  that an invalid email address has been provided.
- `message`: contains a brief message to illustrate what is required for a successful `POST`, this can be especially
  useful for display information back to the user.

___

## Pagination

By default, Verbis limit's all `GET` requests to 15 by default. The `Pagination` object appears under the `meta` key in
the response for browse endpoints.

```json
"meta": {
	"pagination": {
		"page": 1,
		"pages": 1,
		"limit": 15,
		"total": 11,
		"next": false,
		"prev": false
	}
}
```

The pagination object contains the following:

- `page`: the current page.
- `pages`: how many pages there are in total.
- `limit`: how many items are displayed at once.
- `total`: how many items there are in total.
- `next`: is either a boolean set to `false` if there is no next page, or an integer of page number of if there is.
- `prev`: is either a boolean set to `false` if there is no previous page, or an integer of page number of if there is.

___

## Filtering

When requesting a list of resources via the API through browse endpoints, you can apply filters to search through the array of entities.

`/posts&filter={"resource":[{"operator":"=", "value":"verbis"}]}`

In the above url:

- `resource` can be any property attached to the object.
- `operator`: is an allowed operator detailed in the table below.
- `value`: is a value whose type corresponds to the allowed type detailed below.

This call will search all posts that are equal to verbis.

### Available operators:

You can search through a list of entities in Verbis with the following operators:

| Operator      | Description                                                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `=`           | Equal to.                                                               |
| `>`           | Greater than.                                                           |
| `>=`          | Greater than or equal to.                                               |
| `<`           | Less than.                                                              |
| `<=`          | Less than or equal to.                                                  |
| `<>`          | Not equal to.                                                           | 
| `LIKE`        | True if the operand matches a pattern.                                  |
| `IN`          | True if the operand is equal to one of a list of expressions.           |
| `NOT LIKE`    | True if the operand does not match a pattern.                           |
