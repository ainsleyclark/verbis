These walls are essentially a stud (timber) frame with plasterboard nailed over the top.</b></p><p><b>Stud walls have gained particular popularity when creating bedroom ensuites, providing a cost-effective way to divide the space and offer you a separate room entirely. Fortunately, these can also be built DIY, so if you’re considering how to build a stud wall, you’ve come to the right place.</b></p><h3><span style="font-weight: normal;">First of all, we should take a look at the tools and materials you’ll require for the job of erecting a stud wall.</span></h3><div class="parent-table"><table class="table table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td><p><strong><em>The tools</em></strong></p><p>In your toolbox you’ll require:</p><p><br></p><ul class="list list-screw"><li>A saw</li><li>A hammer</li><li>A nailgun</li><li>A spirit level</li><li>A pencil &amp; square</li><li>A workbench</li><li>A large filler knife</li><li>A plumb line.</li></ul></td><td><p><strong><em>The Materials</em></strong></p><p>You’ll also need the following to build a stud wall:</p><p><br></p><ul class="list list-screw"><li>Plasterboard</li><li>Studwork timber</li><li>100mm nails</li><li>Jointing tape</li><li>A sharp knife</li><li>Joining compound.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2>Preparing for the stud wall</h2><h3><p><span style="font-weight: normal;"><font color="#000000">The stud wall is comprised of a timber frame secured to the floor, walls and ceilings, which is then covered with plasterboard. Once complete and decorated to your preferences it’ll look like a normal wall and be part of your home. Although in many cases building a stud wall can be a reasonably straightforward and simple task, it does require a little thought and preparation beforehand.</font></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: normal;"><font color="#000000">Something to consider initially would be Building Regulations. You should ensure any work completed conforms with the latest regulations, rather than falling foul of the law. In particular, you’ll need to consider fire resistance, light and ventilation. If required, you’ll also need to factor in utilities such as plumbing, heating and electricity.</font></span></p></h3><h2>How to build a stud wall (the timber frame)</h2><h3><p>The stud wall frame can be constructed from timber, making it a cost-effective way to create a new room in your home. When constructing the frame you’ll have four areas to think about and these include:</p><p></p><p></p><ul class="list list-screw"><li><strong><em>The ceiling plate:</em></strong>&nbsp;<font style="font-weight: normal;" color="#000000">This is fixed to the ceiling</font></li></ul><p></p><p></p><ul class="list list-screw"><li><strong><em>The floor/soleplate:</em></strong>&nbsp;<font style="font-weight: normal;" color="#000000">This is fixed to the floor</font></li></ul><p></p><p></p><ul class="list list-screw"><li><strong><em>Vertical studs:</em></strong>&nbsp;<font style="font-weight: normal;" color="#000000">These are equally spaced and stand vertically, connecting the ceiling plate to the floor plate</font></li></ul><p></p><p></p><ul class="list list-screw"><li><strong><em>Horizontal braces:</em></strong>&nbsp;<font style="font-weight: normal;" color="#000000">These provide extra support to the stud wall, keeping the frame rigid. They’re fixed between the vertical studs.</font></li></ul><p></p><p></p></h3><h2>Step-by-step guide</h2><p><br></p><div class="step"><p class="step-number">Step 1</p><h3><p><span style="font-weight: normal;"><font color="#000000">This first step should also be considered during the preparation but will entail deciding where your stud wall will be erected. You’ll need to ensure there are no cables or pipes you’ll unwittingly hammer into and an electronic detector would be ideal for this.</font></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: normal;"><font color="#000000">You’ll also need to measure the space you intend the stud wall to use and make a clear measurement on the skirting board.</font></span></p></h3></div><div class="step"><p class="step-number">Step 2</p><h3><p><span style="font-weight: normal;"><font color="#000000">Next, you’ll need a plumb line to hang by the mark you’ve made on the skirting board. This is usually a piece of string suspended from the ceiling, with a weight attached. It’s used to help mark vertical lines, so after hanging the plumb line, use a pencil to mark the vertical line from floor to ceiling.</font></span></p></h3></div><div class="step"><p class="step-number">Step 3</p><p>Bang a nail into the ceiling to mark where your wall junction will be and do the same on the opposite wall too, connecting the two with another drawn line.</p></div><div class="step"><p class="step-number">Step 4&nbsp;</p><h3><p><font style="font-weight: normal;" color="#000000">Your next step is to measure the length of&nbsp;<em><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.buildingmaterials.co.uk/timber-sheet">timber</a></em>&nbsp;you need for the ceiling plate and cut it to size. Ensure to measure a few times to account for the human area before cutting. This will help limit wastage and save you money in the long run.</font></p><p><font style="font-weight: normal;" color="#000000">Now you’ll need to take the timber and mark fixing points along the ceiling, finally screwing it into place with 100mm cross-head wooden nails preferably. Traditional nails could crack the plasterboard and as such, should probably be avoided. This can be quite a tricky task alone, so if there’s someone who could give you a bit of time to help out that’d be the best solution.</font></p></h3></div><div class="step"><p class="step-number">Step 5</p><p>Now you have the ceiling plate in the position it’s time to do the same procedure with the floor plate. Again, measure and cut the timber to fit the space between both walls, taking into account any door space you require. At intervals of 400mm, you should nail the floor plate into position. It’s worth noting that for solid floors you’ll need to use a masonry bit and use plug and screws.</p></div><div class="step"><p class="step-number">Step 6</p><p><font color="#000000">Once the ceiling and floor plates are in position it’s time to start putting the vertical structure of the stud wall into place. Measure the distance between floor and ceiling plates at either end and fix two more timber lengths into place. You may need your saw at this point so the timber can be cut to angle around any skirting board you have.</font></p></div><div class="step"><p class="step-number">Step 7</p><h3><p><span style="font-weight: normal;"><font color="#000000">It’s now time to consider filling the space between both walls with supporting timber lengths. You’ll need vertical studs to connect the floor and ceiling plates, and horizontal lengths to provide increased sturdiness. When fixing the vertical lengths, ensure they’re in position before nailing at angles on both sides of the stud frame.</font></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: normal;"><font color="#000000">Last but not least you have the horizontal supports (otherwise known as noggins) to fit. Measure the space between your vertical supports and cut timber lengths accordingly. Stagger the position of the noggins for greater support and nail in through the vertical studs to secure in place. For sturdier framework, you should also consider&nbsp;<em><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.buildingmaterials.co.uk/plasterboard/metal-stud-wall">metal stud</a></em>&nbsp;systems.</font></span></p></h3></div><h2>How to fit cables and pipes into your stud wall</h2><p>At this stage of the building process, you should have a basic frame in position. Before fitting plasterboard over this space and decorating to your tastes, you should consider the idea of connecting electrical cables or pipes to the new room.</p><p>Just remember, electricity poses a serious health risk and is responsible for a number of fatalities every year in the UK. Any new or modified electrics must comply with IEE Wiring Regulations and could require RCD protection. You must also inform your local Build Control in the event you’re planning changes to electrics in the bathroom.</p><div class="step"><p class="step-number">Step 1</p><p>If your stud wall is being used to create an ensuite, you’ll need to factor plumbing into your thinking. You’ll need to mark the timber studs and carve out access points with a chisel and mallet. An extra tip would be to ensure the carvings slope downwards so pipes will hold once fitted.</p></div><div class="step"><p class="step-number">Step 2</p><p><span style="font-weight: normal;">For electric cables you’ll need to drill into the wood, for wires to be slotted through. Just don’t put electric wiring and pipework in the same hole.</span></p></div><h2>How to build a stud wall (fixing the plasterboard)</h2><p>So, the stud framework has been erected. You’re now ready to fix the plasterboard and finish the work. Again, this would be best with two people – one to hold the plasterboard in place and the other to fix it in position. When fitting the plasterboard, ensure the ivory side is facing outwards.</p><p>This part of the process is reasonably straightforward and you shouldn’t be presented with too many problems. You can simply fit full-size&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.buildingmaterials.co.uk/plasterboard/plasterboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plasterboard</a></em>&nbsp;into place, whilst nailing 32mm plasterboard nails at 150mm intervals.</p><p>Fit all the plasterboard in the same way, until you’ve covered the framework on both sides. To fit around skirting boards you’ll also need to cut out small sections, so the plasterboard slots easily around. And there you have it – You should now know how to build a stud wall.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>',
